# Test task

To start a project go to project folder, execute `yarn` and `yarn dev` go to `localhost:3000`

Task:

- create a page `components/breadcrumbs` that should look like [this page](https://code.ticketmaster.com/aurora/#/breadcrumbs)
- it should NOT be pixel perfect. Also, don't change side nav bar and header design. Just add breadcrumb section next to colors, so a user can navigate to the breadcrumbs page.
- to do that you would need to add an mdx file to `src/md` folder and `breadcrumbs.js` to `pages/components`
- use `Breadcrumb` from `Prism` package to get the actual bread crumbs example. You can do it like so  
  `import { Breadcrumb } from '@ticketmaster/prism';`
- use other pages as an example. e.g. Buttons
- this project is using ReactJs and NextJs, so you can refer to its documentation
- in case of any questions do not hesitate to contact me
